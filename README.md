pylacuna

Python api for Lacuna Expanse
Summary

I'm trying to accomplish three things here.

    Produce generic python libraries for interacting with the Lacuna Expanse game, to allow developers to create their own scripts easily.
    Use those libraries to create useful scripts that help a player perform routine actions.
    Combine those scripts with AI to create an automated bot.

Installation

(Eventually we will want to host this on PyPy so we can just pip install it)

To install (tested on Ubuntu 12.04, requires pip):

// Clone
git clone "https://github.com/miketwo/pylacuna"
cd pylacuna
// Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended -- keeps your comp clean)
virtualenv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
// Install
pip install .

You should now be able to import in your own python script:

import pylacuna

Usage

TBD
Development & Test

To develop and run tests (tested on Ubuntu 12.04):

// Clone
git clone "https://github.com/miketwo/pylacuna"
cd pylacuna
// Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended -- keeps your comp clean)
virtualenv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
// Install in dev mode
pip install -e .
// Run tests
pylacuna_run_tests.sh
// Run main script
pylacuna

ToDo

    so many things, will update here soon...

Architecture

I'm trying to have code at multiple abstraction levels:

    CORE drivers are the raw interface to the JSONRPC. I'm trying to keep them dumb, simple, and stateless, though that last one might be hard. Most are derived from the dict object. We should avoid doing any kind of caching at this layer.

    MIDDLEWARE libraries will have more types of calculations, mission-level logic and hueristics. For example, maybe a method that ranks the nearest planets according to their resource content. Or something that intelligently upgrades the food production on a planet. Caching should go here or higher. Favor composition over inheritence for testability.

    HIGH-LEVEL libraries will include the AI. I'm leaning toward starting with A*, depending on how easy it is to simulate future states. It'll depend a lot on how the middleware layer turns out. I also could incorporate some of the server code to run mini-simulations.

Ideas about AI

A simple approach might be to try to attempt the following

    ENUMERATE all the actions available to the player right now.

    EVALUATE all actions according to a heuristic

    SUGGEST best action

Eventually this might lead to being able to go 2 "moves" ahead, by looping it. Maybe... that requires simulating a lot more of the game itself.
Enumerate all actions

Not sure how to do this. I guess we can check for upgrading every building, building every new building, demolishing every building, building every ship, sending every ship, doing every mission, buying every trade, ... The list of actions is huge. We will need to restrict it at first to be manageable.
Caching Ideas

So far, it seems like it would be best to cache at the building level, using a key that is:

BUILDING_UID + BUILDING_LEVEL

This allows us to deconflict the cache across bodies, as well as cache things that we simulate when we evaluate building upgrades. Also, if a building is upgraded outside the API, this can catch that. The cached item should expire whenever upgrading/downgrading is complete, or work is finished (maybe), or a default of ~1-7 days (still deciding).
First script idea -- babysit production

Look at a planet's 5 main resources (water, energy, ore, food, waste), and upgrade the building that will produce the most positive change (or negative, in the case of waste) to those things. Target a waste/hour of zero (but not below?), and favor upgrading the least abundant resource. Wait until all other upgrading has ceased before taking action.

Step 2: Include building new production buildings in the calculation.
