# pylacuna
Python api for Lacuna Expanse game

I'm trying to accomplish two things here.

1) Produce generic python libraries for interacting with the Lacuna Expanse game. We will try as much as possible to use composition instead of inheritance.

2) Use those libraries with some AI to create an automated bot to play the game.
